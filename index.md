# I make games!

I'm Oleksandr Tykhonov, a passionate game developer. I have been making games for 8 years as a hobby, starting with engines like Game Maker Studio and Multimedia Fusion, then slowly transitioning to more programming oriented game engines like Unity, that I have stuck since. I was working on games simply as a passion in my free time after school. My hobby since transitioned to a career that I wish to pursue. Currently, I am searching for an opportunity at a company to contribute my skills and expand my knowledge of game development!
